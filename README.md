# Quora Question Pair Analysis - NLP Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes Quora question pairs using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to detect and filter out repeated questions. It helps in identifying whether a question has already been asked, reducing redundancy and improving efficiency.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Identifies duplicate questions in a dataset
- 🔍 Uses NLP techniques to compare question similarity
- 📊 Provides structured analysis of question pairs
- ⚡ Optimized for large-scale question datasets

To set up the project, clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash

📊 Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/quora/question-pairs-dataset
The project uses the Quora Question Pairs dataset. Ensure that the dataset is placed in the data/ directory before running the analysis.

🏗️ How It Works
Preprocessing: Cleans and tokenizes text data.
Feature Engineering: Generates text similarity features.
Model Training: Uses NLP models (e.g., TF-IDF, BERT) to classify duplicate questions.
Evaluation: Measures model accuracy and performance.
